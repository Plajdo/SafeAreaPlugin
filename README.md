### What is SafeArea?
SafeArea is a simple plugin that prevents hostile mobs from spawning in marked areas.

 

### Why is SafeArea there?
I'm sure every one of us has built something in Minecraft that looked better in dark. The problem is, when you build it in survival, mobs can spawn and it becomes dangerous at night. And If you don't want to ruin the looks of your build by lighting it up and putting torches everywhere, you have no other choice other than to constantly deal with monsters.

 

This plugin solves this issue by allowing you to mark the area as safe and it will prevent any hostile mobs from spawning in there. Don't worry, pigs, sheep or other friendly entities will still be able to spawn.

 

### How do you use SafeArea?
#### Commands:
- /sa-test
Does nothing, just prints a message confirming that the plugin was loaded successfully.
- /sa-create <x1> <y1> <z1> <x2> <y2> <z2>
Creates a new safe area between two points in your Minecraft world.
From that point on until it's removed it will block spawning of any hostile mobs!
- /sa-remove
Removes the safe area from your world!
Stand in an existing area and type this command to remove it and allow hostile mobs to spawn again.
- /sa-list
Prints into chat a list of all safe areas in your world.
Useful for admins who want to see which locations are marked as safe.
#### Permissions:
- safearea.test
Permits using the /sa-test command.
- safearea.edit
Permits creating and removing any safe areas.
- safearea.list
Permits showing the list of all created safe areas.
- safearea.*
All permissions.
All permissions are for OPs only by default.

 

### Why the X?
A project with the same name sadly exists, but it was deprecated a long time ago, so I thought it would be okay to use this name anyways.

 
 
### Feedback
As this plugin is still considered as a Beta version, all found bugs and your feedback would be much appreciated! ♥
